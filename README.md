# LibCrayonVmu

A library form of Protofall's VmuDeCrayonised example. You can find the original @ https://github.com/Protofall/Homebrew-Tests/tree/master/KallistiOSTests/VmuExample-DeCrayonised

Protofall has stated he won't be maintaining that version of the program anymore in favour of his newer system @ https://github.com/Protofall/Crayon-Savefile/, so this repository contains the most up-to-date version of the old system.

### Building

This version depends on "SConstruct" to build both the library and it's demo, please install it through `pip3`. It works similar to make where you run `scons` when in the same directory as a SConstruct file.
